 About Git 
Git is a version control system that helps track changes in files over time.
It allows multiple people to work on the same project without conflicts.
Using Git, we can go back to previous versions, manage branches, and collaborate easily.



Branches in Git

What is a branch?
A branch is a separate line of development in Git. It allows you to work on changes without affecting the main code.

 Why do teams use branches?
Teams use branches to work on different features or fixes at the same time safely. This helps avoid conflicts and keeps the main branch stable.

 Example of a feature branch
A feature branch is used when developing a new feature, such as adding a login page, while the main branch continues to have stable code.
